/*
 * 1) How can we choose which maze we want for the difficulty modes? (done)
 * 2) Scoring system
 * 3) Refractor Maze.java -> it has to scan in the file (done)
 * 4) A_star and Greedy should return direction
 * 5) A_star, Greedy, Random should inherit the same class
 * 6) resolveCollision(Ghost g) -> Frightened accepts ghosts, and usses it; the other ones -> no (done)
 * 7) move the start postiion to moveable instead of game oBject (done)
 * solution: do not use ghost; return boolean; handle these functions in Game
 * 8) Make the Maze file recognize the H block -> initialize Ghost and PacMan positions based on this
 * 9) Each Algorithm should hold a reference of the appripriate Ghost
 * the .txt files: map (with H block), and a file containing configurations (algorithm + ghost) -> 2 in total 
 *
