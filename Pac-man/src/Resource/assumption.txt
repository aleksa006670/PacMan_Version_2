(1) The kinds of tiles
By design the internal GameObject 2D array inside MazeStub class will keep only static characters. 
PacMan and Ghost will NOT be stored in GameObject array, nor can the MazeStub class tell any information about them.
Note: the "static characters" include: empty tiles (N), power up (U), food (F), gate (G), and wall (W).


Initially, the maze should only contain the following kinds of tiles: food (F), power up (U), gate (G), and wall (W).

(2) Where are the ghosts at the beginning of the game?

	All ghosts will be inside the rectangular house at the beginning of the game. And since the size of our maze
	is fixed to be 28 * 31, the ghosts' coordinates will have the following constraint:
		 11 <= x_coordinate <= 17 AND 13 <= y_coordinate <= 15  (where the index for row and column starts at 0)

(3) In addition to Maze class, I add the following new features for [MazeStub].

	(2.1) Read from a hard-coded map file and create maze accordingly. This is the actual effect when you call generateMaze().

	(2.2) Return the number of tiles that has food at any time. Implemented as getToalNumOfFood().

	(2.3) Use the class Tile a.k.a. empty tile (N) to replace the null cells in GameObject 2D array in MazeStub.java.
	      This is more consistent.

	(2.4 ) Print the maze. Use a char to represent each static character. See toString().





(2) Modifications I made

M	Maze.java: add one more constructor "protected Maze()". This is to make the Maze class can be subclassed by MazeStub.

A	MazeStub.java: the stub that is only for integration purpose. Some Maze functions are NOT properly implemeneted.

A	Tile.java: I add this because I found the empty tiles (N) character is missing.

A	Gate.java: I add this because I found the gate (G) character is missing.

A	TellMyWorkingDirectory.java: for debug purpose, can be safely ignored when commiting to Git.

A 	MazeTest.java: JUnit test file for MazeStub

A	map1.txt : maze map

M	/.classpath : add one line <classpathentry kind="map" path="map"/> so that I can read file in the /map directory
